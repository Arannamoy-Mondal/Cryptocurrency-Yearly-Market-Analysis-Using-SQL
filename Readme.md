## ðŸ“š Project Overview<a name="project-overview"></a>: This project analyzes the real-time impact of the cryptocurrency market on global and national levels. This project is based on yearly data. It explores how crypto mining, ETFs, new investors and traders, and decentralized finance influence employment, the environment, and the economy. The study highlights both positive outcomes, such as job creation, financial inclusion, and innovation, and negative effects, such as energy consumption, financial risk, and regulatory challenges. Real-world examples include the USA, Canada, and El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin, the rise of crypto-based freelancing, and increased global investment through crypto ETFs. It has also become a new financial weapon for some countries, as they use crypto for their strategic reserves. This project serves as a foundational tool for the crypto industry, bridging technical, financial, and regulatory domains to foster innovation, compliance, and market efficiency in real-time scenarios.
